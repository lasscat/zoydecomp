Target size: 16; mode: arm
Metrics: {"candidate_size": 20, "comparator": "unmasked-capstone5-instruction-boundaries-v1", "instruction_differences": null, "masked_fields": [], "near_threshold": {"instructions": 4, "resolved_bytes": 16}, "registers_normalized": false, "resolved_byte_differences": 19, "target_size": 16, "tier": "X"}
Donor: {"adaptation": "Independent DS binary reconstruction; no donor adaptation or gameplay name asserted."}
Blocker: Local comparison only; owner, field meanings and behavior not validated; strict integration gate pending
Failed hypotheses: ["2 isolated hypotheses; best tier X. base(+0x08) + entries(+0x04)[index]; the original fetches both fields with one ldmib, clang emits two ldr (20 vs 16)."]
Next hypothesis: Map DS callers/ownership, then add behavior checks or a new binary-backed shape hypothesis.
Behavior evidence (separate): {"status": "not tested; isolated unmasked comparison only, no behavior evidence"}
