Target size: 20; mode: arm
Metrics: {"candidate_size": 20, "comparator": "unmasked-capstone5-instruction-boundaries-v1", "instruction_differences": 4, "masked_fields": [], "near_threshold": {"instructions": 4, "resolved_bytes": 16}, "registers_normalized": false, "resolved_byte_differences": 4, "target_size": 20, "tier": "N"}
Donor: {"adaptation": "Independent DS binary reconstruction; no donor adaptation or gameplay name asserted."}
Blocker: Local comparison only; owner, field meanings and behavior not validated; strict integration gate pending
Failed hypotheses: ["3 isolated hypotheses; best tier N. swaps two words; N: clang assigns the first temporary to r2 where the original used r3 (4 instructions differ)."]
Next hypothesis: Map DS callers/ownership, then add behavior checks or a new binary-backed shape hypothesis.
Behavior evidence (separate): {"status": "not tested; isolated unmasked comparison only, no behavior evidence"}
